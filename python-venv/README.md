# Setup after creating this project from the template


1. Rename the directory `src/TODO` to your library's name, e.g. `src/myfunlib`.
2. There are several things marked with TODO in the created files where you will
   have to enter the corresponding information (e.g.  author's name, package
   name etc.).
